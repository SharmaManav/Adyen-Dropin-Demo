# Adyen-Dropin-Demo

My submission for the Implementation Engineer role at Adyen. This project mainly utilizes Node and Express. 

This definitely looked easy at a first glance but proved to require a good amount of research and taught me some things along the way.
Still running into some iframe errors with the credit card payment method though.

The [code samples](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-components-js-sample-code) definitely helped with the implementation side of things and
the [documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/checkout/drop-in-web) gave great instructions and overview of how everything worked together.

Overall, fun project and for sure deepened my knowledge of APIs.

# How To Run

Add the required key and account to a .env file following the .env_sample format to run this project.

'npm i' in the root folder, then 'npm start' and head over to localhost:3000
